Itâ€™s dog time! 

The purpose of this project was to successfully perform ETL on a series of data sets in a group setting. We took advantage of the variety of data sets 
available on Kaggle and chose to examine data available on dogs living in New York. The first data set included here is a csv file including a sample of 
16,217 names of dogs living in NYC and the second data set includes 121827 licensed dogs in NYC.
